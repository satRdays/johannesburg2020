    <h3 class="center">R Package Development</h3>
    <!-- <h5 class="center">Sub-title</h5> -->
    <h4>Heather Turner</h4>

    <p>Curious about package development but not sure where to start? This workshop is for you! The goal is to empower you to contribute back to the R ecosystem through writing your own packages or contributing to others. We’ll be using materials developed by Hadley Wickham, Jenny Bryan, and others on the <a href="https://forwards.github.io/about/">Forwards teaching team</a>.</p>

    <p>By the end of this workshop, you should know how to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>turn your code into an R package,</li>
        <li>use GitHub as an effective collaboration tool,</li>
        <li>add a vignette or an article,</li>
        <li>build a web page for your package, and</li>
        <li>submit a package to CRAN.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Prerequisites: Participants should know how to write functions in R. Knowledge of <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/index.html">R markdown</a> will be beneficial.</p>
    
    <p>Computing requirements: Attendees are encouraged to set up the required tools on their laptops as described <a href="https://github.com/forwards/workshops/blob/master/Computing_requirements.md">here</a>. Alternatively, an RStudio cloud with the required tools will be accessible for the duration of the workshop.</p>
    
    <p>Participants may bring their own code that they want to make into a package, or work with the example provided.</p>


    <h3 class="center">Building Successful Shiny Apps with {golem}</h3>
    <!-- <h5 class="center">Sub-title</h5> -->
    <h4>Colin Fay</h4>
    
    <p><a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> is an amazing tool when it comes to creating web applications with R. Building a proof-of-concept application is easy, but things change when the application becomes larger and more complex, especially when it comes to sending that app to production. Until recently, there hasn't been any real framework for building and deploying production-grade Shiny apps. This is where {golem} comes into play: offering Shiny developers an opinionated framework for creating production-ready Shiny applications.</p>
    
    <p>With {golem}, Shiny developers now have a toolkit for making a stable, easy-to-maintain, and robust for production web application with R. {golem} has been developed to abstract away the most common engineering tasks (for example, module creation, the addition of external CSS or JavaScript file, ...), so you can focus on what matters: building the application. Once your application is ready to be deployed, {golem} guides you through testing and brings you the tool for deploying to common platforms.</p>
    
    <p>In this workshop, attendees will be introduced to the {golem} package, then guided through the full development of a shiny app, from start to deployment!</p>
    
    <p>Prerequisites: Attendees are expected to be already familiar with Shiny. Knowledge about package development would be advantageous.</p>
    <!-- <h3 class="center">Data Carpentry Workshop for R novices</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.datacarpentry.org">Data Carpentry</a> workshops teach introductory computational skills needed for data management and analysis in all domains of research. For tickets and more information on the syllabus please visit the <a href="https://binxiepeterson.github.io/2019-04-03-satRday-jhb/">
    workshop webpage</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Registration for this workshop is separate from sat<b>R</b>day.</strong></p> -->

    <h3 class="center">Web Scraping with R</h3>
    <h4>Megan Beckett & Andrew Collier</h4>
    
    <p>Often the data you need is already available on a website. It might all be on one page (if you're lucky!) or distributed across many pages (possibly hundreds or thousands of pages!).</p>

    <p>But you want those data consolidated locally. Not on a server in some distant land, but right there on your hardware. And in a convenient format. CSV or JSON, perhaps? Certainly not HTML!</p>

    <p>What would Ragnar do? He'd go out, grab those data and bring them home.</p>

    <p>The contemporary Internet Viking uses web scraping techniques to systematically extract information from web pages. This workshop will demonstrate the process of web scraping. Here’s the battle plan:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharpening the Axe: Understanding the structure of an HTML document.</li>
        <li>Preparing the Longships: Using the DOM to select HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Doing Battle: Using {rvest} to extract data from an HTML document.</li>
        <li>Stashing the Treasure: Storing data as CSV or JSON.</li>
        <li>Triumphant Return: Handling dynamic content using {RSelenium}.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first two topics will be fairly brief, covering this material at a high level. We'll dig much deeper into the latter topics. By the end of the workshop you will be able to easily (and confidently) scrape large swathes of the internet. We’re considerate Vikings, so you’ll also learn how to do this ethically and mindfully. :)</p>

    <p>This tutorial will be suitable for Vikings with low to moderate levels of R experience. We'll use RStudio Cloud to ensure that everybody has the same infrastructure and (hopefully) avoid most technical issues.</p>
