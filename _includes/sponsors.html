    <h2>Sponsors</h2>
    <p> Becoming a sponsor is a great opportunity to show your commitment to the continued growth and diversification of the local R community while raising brand awareness, headhunting potential talent for your organization and helping us make the conference a lasting success. </p>

    <p> One of the key objectives of satRday is to make the conference accessible to all, including students, by keeping ticket prices low. At the same time we also want to provide attendees with a brilliant conference experience. This means we rely heavily on sponsorship. </p>

    <p>If you'd like to come on board as a sponsor please email us and we'll gladly send you our Sponsorship Prospectus, which lays out the various options in terms of costs and benefits.</p>

<!--     <p>
        We thank our generous sponsors for supporting sat<b>R</b>day. Your financial help and commitment to the R community is greatly appreciated and essential to making this event possible!
