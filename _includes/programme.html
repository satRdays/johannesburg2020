							<li class="talk"> The magic of colour: the pursuit to derive several hundred unique palettes (Francois Van Heerden)
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>Our final outputs from R will often take on the form of a graph, map, infographic or other relevant visual. These visualisations are not devoid of creative elements. They require colour, and sometimes they require a multitude of custom palettes for the task at hand. How best can these be derived?</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> Easy-peasy plots with {esquisse} (Bianca Peterson) <i class="fa fa-flash lightning" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Lightning talk"></i>
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>Do you wish you could drag and drop variables onto X and Y axes and easily map variables? Are you in a hurry (or just plain lazy) to type code by hand? The {esquisse} add-in lets you explore and visualise your data with {ggplot2} interactively and provides the generated code to reproduce the chart!</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> Mapping out African genomics research with sf (Kirsty Lee Garson) <i class="fa fa-flash lightning" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Lightning talk"></i>
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>Advances in our understanding of the human genome have largely been based on European populations. More recently, a number of studies have been investigating African populations, which have a higher degree of genetic diversity. What better way to map them out than with a bit of help from sf?</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> Productivity Hacks with your .Rprofile (Cesaire Tobias) <i class="fa fa-flash lightning" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Lightning talk"></i>
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>Have you ever wanted a set of productivity boosting tools to help make your workflow more efficient? Do you ever wonder what anyone does with their .Rprofile? If you answered yes to both these questions then this lightning talk is for you.</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> Use of vtreat for R package and regression modelling for algorithmic financial planning (Anisa Mathura) <i class="fa fa-flash lightning" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Lightning talk"></i>
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>My talk focuses on the construction of a generalized additive model (GAM) to relate healthcare service efficiency and operational metrics to clinic profitability (profit per day). My modelling used vtreat for R (John Mount and Nina Zumel) as it made the modelling process and output a tidy-treat!</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> SHAP: Interpreting ML Models with IML (Drikus du Toit)
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>Interpretability is still regarded as one of the main barriers of machine learning. How do we explain a model decision to a client? How do we measure the underlying interactions in a black box model? Let's have a look at Shapley Values as a model agnostic technique for interpreting ML models.</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> purrr beyond map (Hendrik van Broekhuizen)
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>There is so much more to purrr than map(). purrr is a veritable treasure trove of functional awesomeness that can help transform the code you write and what it can do. In this talk, I illustrate what lies beyond map(), how to use it, and why it may be worth exploring purrr's hidden depths.</p>

								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>One of the most challenging tasks in data science is moving code from a development through to production. Build on top of Apache Spark, Databricks provides streamlined workflows and interactive workspaces that enable collaboration between Data scientists, data engineers and business analysts.</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> Taking R and shiny to production (Gaonyalelwe Maribe)
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>This talk shows the endless possibilities of R and shiny's capabilities in a production environment using docker and ShinyProxy. In this talk I will demonstrate how to build and deploy a shiny application (statistical ad hoc report) for each user in an isolated docker container on a linux server.</p>
								</div>
							<li class="talk"> <b>Keynote</b>: "prod" is not a four-letter word (Colin Fay)
								<div class="session-abstract abstract">
									<p>The idea that R is not a good fit for engineering production software is a catchphrase we hear a lot in the world of data science, and in the software engineering community in general. But the truth is that the R community has been creating tools for building robust software for years—tools that have been proven to be reliable and efficient, making R a legitimate language for production. </p>
									<p>With all the available tooling, the real challenge of sending R to production is not technical—it's all a matter of attitude. In other words, the real challenge is our ability to adopt a software engineering mindset when building tools with R. </p>
									<p>So where do we start our journey to production quality with R? What are these tools that help us building reliable products? How do we think about R with 'deploy to production' in mind? These are the questions, amongst others, that Colin will try to answer during his keynote, which will hopefully help you become more confident about sending R into production.</p>

							  <div class="session-abstract abstract">
								  <p>In the past few years, the R Community has been making conscious efforts to widen the participation of underrepresented groups. This talk will review some of the initiatives that have contributed to this effort, including Forwards, a task force set up by the R Foundation.</p>
								  <p>A lot of progress has been made and the R Community is now recognized for its inclusiveness. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in the technical side of the R project (developer meetings, package development, R core development) and in the general user community for specific groups (people living in underserved regions or people with disabilities that affect access). This talk will consider these challenges and discuss some ways we might move forwards to achieve greater equity and inclusion.</p>
